# SimpleWebApp
Create a web app.  You may choose any .Net web app technology (WebForms, ASP.Net MVC, ASP.Net Core MVC).
Add several pages with different paths and arbitrary content.
Implement a login system

    It should accept a username and password
    The password should be the username spelled backwards (e.g. username=”test”, password=”tset”).  The system should accept any valid username/password pair.

Once the user is logged in, display the currently logged in username on each page.
